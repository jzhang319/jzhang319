## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jack Zhang!

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer, living in DC Metro Area.

My Story

My coding journey sparked unconsciously when I crafted a custom quadratic formula program on a TI-89 calculator in high school. Fast forward to the beginning of 2022, during the lockdown, I enrolled in and successfully completed the top-ranked full-stack software engineering bootcamp at App Academy. There, I delved into full stack web development, gaining versatile skills to tackle various tech stacks. App Academy not only equipped me with the tools to learn anything I set my mind to but also deepened my understanding and technical ability to effectively explain concepts to others. Excited about continuous learning and building meaningful projects!

Currently

During my free time, I've been contributing as a software engineer at Coursect, developing a tutoring platform that leverages the OpenAI API. Our focus is on aiding students in grades 8 to 12 with their studies in math, chemistry, and physics. Additionally, my team and I are implementing automations to alert doctors when their patients' lab and test results reach critical thresholds, requiring prompt attention. Our tech stack includes JavaScript with React for the frontend and Python with Flask for server functionality. Excited about the impact of technology in education.

Technologies and Experience

My most recent solo project was built with Python and Django backend which I really enjoy working with after graduating from App Academy. During the bootcamp I learned how to build backend servers with the Express framework in the NodeJS environment for a number of my other projects (such as Where-will-i-stay-bnb and Pixelgram linked below).

I build my own front ends and have extensive experience with Javascript React, and Redux. I have built front end components using HTML from scratch and style with vanilla CSS but have recently found a love for building my frontends using Materil UI components.

Additionally I have experience using both relational and non-relational databses. My projects have utilized SQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
