My Story:

**My coding journey sparked unconsciously when I crafted a custom quadratic formula program on a TI-89 calculator in high school.** Fast forward to the beginning of 2022, during the lockdown, I enrolled in and completed the top-ranked full-stack software engineering boot camp at App Academy. There, I delved into full-stack web development, gaining versatile skills to tackle various tech stacks. App Academy not only equipped me with the tools to learn anything I set my mind to but also deepened my understanding and technical ability to explain concepts to others effectively. I am excited about continuous learning and building meaningful projects!

Currently:

I've been contributing as a software engineer at Coursect Inc., developing a tutoring platform that leverages the OpenAI, and Google API. We focus on aiding students in grades 8 to 12 with their math, chemistry, and physics studies. Our tech stack includes JavaScript with React for the front end and Python with Flask for server functionality. Excited about the impact of technology on education.

Technologies and Experience

My recent solo project, developed post-App Academy, features a **Python, Flask backend and Javascript, React for the frontend**, a tech combo I thoroughly enjoy. During the boot camp, I also honed my backend skills using the Express framework in the NodeJS environment for various projects, including "Pixelgram",  "Where-will-i-stay-bnb" and "Question Overflow" (links below).

I take pride in crafting my own front ends, showcasing expertise in JavaScript, React, and Redux. Building front-end components from scratch with HTML and styling them with vanilla CSS has been a staple, but lately, I've developed a fondness for creating frontends using Material UI components.

On the database front, I bring experience with both relational and non-relational databases. My projects have seamlessly integrated SQL, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. Check out my work below!
